## Notes

- Main challenges were initializing state variables and handling user interactions.
- Implementing a carousel effect for card navigation required modulus logic for seamless wrap-around.
- Applying the `useEffect` hook was key, especially for filtering cards by category and difficulty.
- Explored CSS Grid and Flexbox for styling, ultimately preferring Flexbox for its simplicity.
- This project deepened my understanding of React state, hooks, and modern CSS layouts.
