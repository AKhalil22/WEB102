## Notes

One challenge was mapping county data from the JSON file onto individual cards using .map(). Instead of using generic keys, I used county names for clearer identification. Styling the images consistently across cards was also tricky due to varying dimensions, but I resolved this with CSS techniques like clamp() to keep headings and layouts uniform. The most complex part was implementing sorting: I used Reactâ€™s useState to track the selected option, then applied a switch statement to sort and re-render the county cards based on the chosen criteria.
