## Notes

Challenges/Learning Curves:
- Mapping county data from the JSON file to individual cards using `.map()` required careful handling; using county names improved clarity.
- Ensuring consistent image styling across cards was tricky due to different image dimensions, but CSS techniques like `clamp()` helped keep headings and layouts uniform.
- Implementing sorting was the most complex part: I used React’s `useState` to track the selected option and implemented a custom switch statement to sort and re-render the county cards based on the chosen criteria.
